# Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing System

## Description
This project is a system that allows for secure and privacy-preserving data sharing using techniques like homomorphic encryption and differential privacy.

## Skills
- Cryptography
- Python
- Data Privacy

## Features
- Homomorphic encryption for secure data processing
- Differential privacy for data anonymization
- Secure data sharing by combining both techniques

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Barrosleo/Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-System/src
    ```
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install seal numpy syft
    ```

## Usage
- Run the homomorphic encryption script:
    ```bash
    python homomorphic_encryption.py
    ```
- Run the differential privacy script:
    ```bash
    python differential_privacy.py
    ```
- Run the secure data sharing script:
    ```bash
    python secure_data_sharing.py
    ```
